;; The sliding-tile puzzle (i.e. the eight/fifteen/twentyfour puzzle).
;; Tile positions are encoded by the predicate (at <tile> <x> <y>), i.e.
;; using one object for horizontal position and one for vertical (there's
;; a separate predicate for the position of the blank). The predicates
;; "inc" and "dec" encode addition/subtraction of positions.

;; The instance files come in two flavors: The vanilla one uses the same
;; objects for both x and y coordinates, while the other (files that have
;; an "x" at the end of their name) uses different objects for x and y
;; coordinates; this is because some planners seem to require different
;; objects for each parameter of an operator.
